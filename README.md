CODING WITH SANTA DOCUMENTATION
_______________________________

A quick project for Khan Academy's interview project. 

Creates SantaClaus.js, an API that utilizes Acorn.js to test user's code against desired code.
Implements the API on a single-page website using CodeMirror and React. 

Entire project is generated with Yeoman's react-gulp-browserify generator. 
(There is still some leftover bloat files from Yeoman's generator that needs to be hunted down and cleaned)
